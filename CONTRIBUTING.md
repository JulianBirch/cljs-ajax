`cljs-ajax` is fundamentally a collaborative project. Each issue raised, every question asked informs its design. All pull requests are welcome, but we do ask that any changes come with tests that demonstrate the original problem. For this, you'll need to get the test environment working. You need to install [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) somewhere on your path.
Obviously, commits that fail the Travis build are unlikely to be accepted.
New releases tend to get announced on Twitter with credit to contributors. 
If you want an @mention, make sure to tell us your handle.
Equally, if you don't want to be mentioned, make sure to tell us that.

If you're looking for something to do some open source work, take a look at the issue tracker. `cljs-ajax` always has a lot of issues marked welcome". Drop a li"PR ne if you're interested in working on anything.

After that `lein run-tests` should run the tests.

If you just think the documentation needs improving, please send a PR. We've accepted over 100 documentation PRs already.
